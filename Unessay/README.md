# HIST-230 UNESSAY PROJECT

Title of Project: Executioner Survivors

Author: Andrew Han

Description: I took inspiration from an extremely popular indie game that came out in 2022 called Vampire Surivors, which ended up winning multiple awards, and spawning hundreds of what are now called "Vampire Survivors clones." I think that in a way the game was genre-defining, based off of all of these clones that were made, so I wanted to try my hand at creating my own take on the game. Although there are many elements that are similar gameplay-wise to the game, I created all of the code from scratch, using a tutorial I found on how to make a 2D game in Java (Credits: RyiSnow on YouTube; this is the tutorial playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om59cwR7psI&list=PL_QPQmz5C6WUF-pOQDsbsKbaBZqXj4qSq). I used his tutorials as a framework to build upon, because this is my first time trying to create something like this, and I needed a little help to get started. Even with these influences, I still think this project shows a lot of creativity, because I created all the art/sprites by myself, and I implemented my own classes/code, which makes my game look drastically different from the tutorial I followed. I did not completely finish the game yet, but it has reached a playable state, and I am happy with the amount of time I put in. I sadly didn't keep a log of my hours, but I would estimate that I spent 40+ hours on this project alone. 

Gameplay:
    * If you're not familiar with Vampire Survivors, you essentially kill enemies that continually spawn in and swarm you, trying to survive 30 minutes, after which you win. If you touch an enemy, you start losing health, if your health bar reaches 0, you die. Killing enemies drops experience crystals, once you collect enough of them you can level up and gain new items to make you grow stronger.

Controls:
    * WASD to move (or Arrow Keys)
    * Space to interact, move dialogue forward, pick an upgrade

Future Updates (AKA the To-Do List):
    * add more items
    * make the map bigger
    * add lore
    * fix enemy collisions
    * watch rest of tutorial videos
    * letters around the map
    * secret ending
    * npcs = famous figures
